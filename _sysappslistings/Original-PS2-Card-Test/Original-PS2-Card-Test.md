This application tries to auth memory cards on both ports with developer magicgate

Original memory cards support this, while no bootleg card seems to do so (developer tested with 7 of them)

If the card passes the test it could be a good sign that you have an original card

IMPORTANT NOTE:
To avoid issues, please make sure to unplug and replug the cards before running the test ELF. seems like when cards are authenticated once with retail keys they cant go back to developer keys untill theyre disconnected
