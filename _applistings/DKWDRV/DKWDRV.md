DKWDRV is a replacement for the original PS1DRV of Playstation 2 consoles. The original driver was heavily limited in features (sometimes on purpose and sometimes not) making user experience a real hassle. DKWDRV aims at overcoming this issues and making a much better gaming experience. Built from scratch by reversing both types of original drivers and merging them into one single unified driver. This project is not related in any way with any existing PS1 related PS2 homebrews out there.

At the moment the project can be considered BETA and many issues can come due to the big number of hardware and game differences. Users are welcome to submit issues or request features.

With time more details and documentation about PS1 operation in PS2 mode will be provided.
