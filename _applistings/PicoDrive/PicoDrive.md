This is yet another SEGA 8 bit and 16 bit console emulator.
<br>
It can run games developed for most consumer hardware released by SEGA, up to and including the 32X:
<br>
16 bit systems: Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega/Mega CD, 32X, Pico  
8 bit systems: SG-1000, SC-3000, Master System/Mark III, Game Gear  
PicoDrive was originally created with ARM-based handheld devices in mind, but later received various cross-platform improvements such as SH2 recompilers for MIPS (mips32r2), ARM64 (armv8), RISC-V (RV64IM) and PowerPC (G4/2.03).
